* Using the Gapminder dataset, please complete the following for the next seminar:
	* determine the rate of change of lifeExp, pop, or gdpPerCap for two countries
	* plot these rates of change again each other and comment on the results
	* comment on the statistical limitations of your results and possible remedies

1. Create STAT_450 repository on your personal Github account
2. Get familiar with the R and Git routine by following the tutorial [here](https://www.r-bloggers.com/rstudio-and-github/).
3. First, get familiar with [Markdown](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/). Then, in the STAT_450 repo, initiate a README.md that includes the following:
	* Description about yourself
	* Photo of yourself or something that interests you
	* Description of what you aim to take away from STAT 450
4. Begin populating your STAT_450 repo with material and tasks you have completed so far. For instance, you should have a folder called Week1_Seminar, where you will place the Gapminder task completed the previous week. In this repo, initialize another README.md that interprets your results of the task. Follow the format I used below (code, plot, description).
5. Stay organized!

1. Navigate to the Data_Exploration and walk through the example.
2. Modify the function or create your own function (glm, etc.), where the output will be the parameter(s) of interest.
3. Follow the structure in the example, and examine the hypothesis of whether a significant difference exists between the distribution of model parameters in at least one of the continents.
4. State your results and conclusion in an intuitive way.
5. Why do we care about performing this analysis with your selection of model parameters?
